Rahil:
1) I have read the details of the IEX Traidng API and created Model called Quotes to read the API details.
Along with the details,i have added a property as week52PriceRange to calculate the week 52 price range strategy.
2)We have picked the 52-Week Price Range Strategy which calculates the ratio to take the top 5 stocks whose score is 82% or higher.
3)It was found that after calculations,we got the scenarios where the company names are empty, the denominato in the week52Price
Range is 0 , Iexenabled values as false.We have removed those values and tried to get the valid companies from the list
4)We faced some issues due to the API limitations of allowing only 100 symbols.We fetched all the symbol's data'
and filtered those quotes whose difference between high value and low value is zero.


Aayush:
1)I have handled UI part of designing web pages for top 5 stocks page which displays all the values of stocks.
2)I have created a web page to display the quote values of the top 5 stocks which is coming from the temp data.
3)I made sure that all the null exceptions are checked and handled in the server side.
